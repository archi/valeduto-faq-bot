These can be followed for manual installs/upgrades/downgrades as well.
In case you forgot to package valetudo when building the rooted firmware, or Valetudo was lost in a reset, or you want to install a different version of Valetudo.
For the manual variant, check-out the non-recommended `/fuckup manual`.
