1. Always set the adapter to voltage stated in the rooting docs. An incorrect voltage <b>will destroy your robot</b>.
2. For our vacuum robots, <b>never</b> connect the voltage (labelled V+, 3V3 or 5V) pin as it <b>will damage your robot or PC</b>!
3. Only connect GND, RX and TX
4. TX (transmit) on one side goes to RX (receive) on the other
5. Sometimes a manufacturer mislabels RX and TX. If you see nothing on your serial monitor, swap RX and TX.
