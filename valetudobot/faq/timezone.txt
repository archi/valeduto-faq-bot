text:
Valetudo always uses UTC internally. Since most robots lack a proper RTC, Valetudo relies on NTP to setup the correct time.
If your time is off, make sure you're not blocking NTP in your firewall (or use a local NTP server).

Valetudo will not execute any timers if it is unable to sync the time via NTP.
