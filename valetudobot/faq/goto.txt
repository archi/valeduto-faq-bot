Not all robots support this feature!

1. On the Home map, click on the Map Mode Selection (top right of the map), select "Go To".
2. Click anywhere on the map you want the robot to go.
3. Then long-click on the GO TO LOCATION button (bottom right of map), a dialog comes up with the actual payload for MQTT including coords, which can also be used for REST.

If your robot does not have this feature, you can try defining a very small zone at the target location, sending your robot to do a zone clean up for that zone, and then cancel the clean up once the robot reaches the zone. This is rather fragile, but the only option.
