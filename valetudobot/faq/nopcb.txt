text:
While you can do whatever you want, only supported setups are supported. There will be no support for unsupported setups.
If you decide to not follow the instructions, you will have to solve your own problems.
That explicitly means not having to ask questions about what to do, what works, etc.

The PCB is <b>not</b> a way of monetization for the project. In fact, is is explicitly meant <b>not to be sold</b> but shared.

It is simply a passive adapter existing purely to rule out common issues caused by bad cabling, bad signal integrity, flaky connections etc.
And a cheap one at that too; per PCB costing less than 1% of what you paid for your robot.

The KiCAD project for self-manufacturing + a soldering guide can be found on Github

Alternatively, you may also join the PCB Sharing Group, where you might find other people in your area that would be willing to share their PCB with you.
