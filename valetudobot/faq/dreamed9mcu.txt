title: Early Dreame MCU Issues
short-title: d9mcu
text:
If your Dreame D9 stops working a few seconds after any command or shows other erratic behavior after initially rooting/a firmware update, the MCU of your robot is likely in an invalid state.
This seems to be a bug in the bootloader of the MCU of early dreames where it fails to switch the firmware slot after an update.

Most of the time, this can be fixed by the following procedure:

- Make sure that the robot is docked
Repeat the following three times:
- Download the dustbuilder firmware update package onto the robot
- run install-manual.sh
- Wait for it to reboot

If this doesn't help, another thing you can do is undock the robot and let it sit somewhere for 12h+ so that the battery runs out.
This will power-cycle the MCU and should bring back a working robot.
