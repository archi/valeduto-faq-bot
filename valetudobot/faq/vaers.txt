VAERS is a ticket system run by the team that is used to handle advanced questions and issues that may arise when rooting supported (<code>/faq supported</code>) robots.

For example, cases in which opening a VAERS ticket is the way to go would be things like:
- bricked robots (flashing LEDs without any function)
- weird and erratic robot behavior (e.g. weird navigation, robot shutting off for no apparent reason, etc.)
- failure to use rooting methods (e.g. for newly produced devices)

Reminder:
Do not leak any information from private conversations in the VAERS system.
