Consider this info graphic when soldering.
Don't put the solder on the iron (just a thin coat after cleaning, like the text says), instead apply heat (iron) and solder on the part at the same time - just as the info graphic's first row shows.

Also check your solder joints (second row), since bad joints cause issues like not being able to send keyboard input to your robot (or worse).
